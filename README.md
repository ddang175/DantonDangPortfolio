# Danton Dang's Portfolio

A 3D portfolio website inspired by Tokyo night markets and alleyways, built with React, TypeScript, and Three.js. This portfolio showcases my work, creativity, and personality as an engineer through an immersive 3D experience.

## About

This portfolio is heavily inspired by Tokyo alleyways and night life, featuring a Toyota AE86 Trueno Sprinter (one of my favorite cars) as the centerpiece. I wanted to create something different from typical engineering portfolios - something that showcases my personality and provides visitors with a unique experience.

The site uses Three.js for 3D graphics and animations, creating an immersive environment that reflects my love for Japanese car culture and urban aesthetics.
